This project contains a simple implementation of a Vector3D class in C++.
The program demonstrates basic 3D vector operations through console input/output.
Overview

The Vector3D class supports:

    1. Vector addition and subtraction;

    2. Dot product;

    3. Cross product;

    4. Scalar multiplication and division;

    5. Vector negation (reflection);

    6. Norm (magnitude) calculation;

    7. Printing vector coordinates;

File

    ppp.cpp â€” main source code file.

Usage

    1. Compile the program:

g++ ppp.cpp -o vector3d

    2. Run the executable:

./vector3d

    3. Enter the coordinates for two vectors and a scalar value when prompted.

Example input/output:

Enter the vector value a (x1 y1 z1): 1 2 3
Enter the vector value b (x2 y2 z2): 4 5 6
Enter the scalar value c: 2

a + b = (5, 7, 9)
a - b = (-3, -3, -3)
Dot product a . b = 32
Norm of a = 3.74166
